            not quickly think we are there yet. There is still a long way to go in the field of deep learning
            as a whole, and it's applications in bioinformatics.

            The deep convolutional neural network has been used in this project thanks to its feature extraction
            abilities. This does not imply that it is probably the only architecture out there, neither is it the
            best of all time. We hope that in the future more sophosticated and powerful architectures can be
            invented, better loss functions, better optimization algorithms and most importantly better ways of
            interpreting these networks.

            Promoter sequences were used here as predictors of expression. We must however remember that expression
            is a complex process controlled by several factors and not just the promoter elements. Transcription factors,
            enhancers, trans-regulatory elements and environmental influence are all contributors to expression. In fact
            a gene may be completely okay and its promoter completely okay but it fails to be expressed for one or several
            reasons we can not predict easily by deep learning alone.

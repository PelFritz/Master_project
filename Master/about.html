          <p class="notification is-info" >The rapid boost in next generation sequencing
          technologies has increased the sizes of databases. In fact, with these new technologies,
          scientist are opened to new possibilities and definitely new challenges. What used to be
          a problem of lack of data, has now become a problem of how to store these data and
          how to extract the information burried deep within. Thanks to organisms like <i>Arabidopsis
          thaliana</i> and a group of others known as model organisms, plant biologist have had
          more insights as to how the genetic material of plants drive everything we see from germination
          to anthesis and to fruits.

              If we take a step back to look at the <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>,
              it is amazing how all of the diversity seen in the world is encoded by four nucleotides
              efficiently repeated by nature to varrying lengths. A computer programmer may be tempted to
              say the genetic code is the easiest code to write, but it remains the most difficult code
              to decrypt. From the discovery of transposable elements by Barbara McClintock to the invention
              of the <abbr title="Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats">CRISPR</abbr>
              gene editing technologies, much efforts have been directed towards linking genetic diversity
              to the genetic code. In this project deep convolutional networks are used to discover the
              patterns within the genetic code.

            <p class="notification is-dark">Bluntly put, gene expression is the conversion of information from the
              DNA to phenotypes. The information in the <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> is
              sent to <abbr title="Ribonucleic acid">RNA</abbr> in a process called transcription. The
              information is then forwarded to proteins in a process called translation. Again this pathway
              is an over summarized form of genetic information transfer and a gene is considered expressed
              as long as it undergoes transcription. This does not by no means imply that all genes that are
              transcribed get to the stage of proteins or produce external phenotypic traits.
              Some of the <abbr title="Ribonucleic acid">RNA</abbr> produced can act as molecules on their own,
              others are precursors for further
              downstream information transfer and others get degraded. After using the word phenotypes, one
              may be wondering what phenotypes are then. Well genes and their variants make up the primary
              phenotypes, everything between a gene and the external physical trait will make up the
              intermediate phenotypes an the physical traits themselves are the terminal phenotypes.

            Artificial neural networks are an inspiration from the brain's architecture albeit some
            deviation from their biological cousins. They are at the core of deep learning, from
            powering google to things like youtube and even Apple's famous Siri. The most important
            similarity between artificial neural nertworks and the brain is the hierarchy in which
            information is transfered.<img src="images/neurons-1739997_1920.jpg" alt="neurons"
            width="300" height="300" class="ANN"> If we look at the brain on the left constructed
            by only its neurons, we quickly realise interconnection between several neurons. The
            hierarchy within such a net may not be seen from this image but there exist such a
            hierarchical structuring in our brains.
            The Hubel and Wiesel model presents the visual cortex structure as follows:
            LGB (lateral geniculate body)→simple cells→complex
            cells→lower order hypercomplex cells→higher order hypercomplex cells. It is in fact from
            this model that Fukushima gained his inspiration of the neocognitron which is the
            pioneer inspiration of modern day convolutional neural networks.
            <i class="quotation">
              The one thing humans however
              have which artificial neural networks lack is perception. When you look at the picture of
              a cute puppy you can not choose not to see the puppy or its cuteness. Neither can you explain
              how you recognized a cute puppy; it's just obvious.
            </i> Our attention in this project was focused on one specific artificial neural network, the
            deep convolutional neural network. These networks are used primarily for image classification
            because they can identify features within images. Once a feature has been identified, it's position
            in future images is irrelevant. Another beuaty of these architectures is that they are not fully
            connected. This means each neuron is only connected to a set of neurons within a small area  of the
            previous layer called it's receptive field.

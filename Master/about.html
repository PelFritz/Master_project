          <p class="notification is-info" >The rapid boost in next generation sequencing
          technologies has increased the sizes of databases. In fact, with these new technologies,
          scientist are opened to new possibilities and definitely new challenges. What used to be
          a problem of lack of data, has now become a problem of how to store these data and
          how to extract the information burried deep within. Thanks to organisms like <i>Arabidopsis
          thaliana</i> and a group of others known as model organisms, plant biologist have had
          a more insights as to how the genetic material of plants drive everything we see from germination
          to anthesis and to fruit.

              If we take a step back to look at the <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>,
              it is amazing how all of the diversity seen in the world in encoded by four nucleotides
              efficiently repeated by nature to varrying lengths. A computer programmer may be tempted to
              say the genetic code is the easiest code to write, but it remains the most difficult code
              decrypt. From the discovery of transposable elements by Barbara McClintock to the invention
              of the <abbr title="Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats">CRISPR</abbr>
              gene editing technologies, much effort has been directed towards linking genetic diversity
              to genetic code.
